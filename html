This project is a responsive chatbot interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simulated messaging experience where users can type and send messages to a chatbot. The user interface is carefully designed with a dark-themed aesthetic, ensuring an elegant, modern look that is both visually appealing and functional.

Purpose:
The goal of this project is to create an intuitive and responsive chat UI that can later be expanded with advanced chatbot functionality such as NLP (Natural Language Processing) and speech synthesis. For now, the project demonstrates fundamental front-end skills, including layout design, responsiveness, and interactive elements.

1. User Interface Design
1.1. Dark-Themed Layout:
The entire project uses a dark theme. This design choice was made to reduce eye strain and give the application a sleek, modern feel.

The background color of the webpage is a rich, deep purple (#290066), which serves as the base for the dark theme.
The chatbot container itself uses a light gradient (linear-gradient(to bottom right, #ffffff, #d9e2f3)) to contrast against the dark background, ensuring the chat interface stands out.
The header and footer of the chatbot are styled with a dark gradient (#28292a to #1a1e21), giving the application a cohesive look.
1.2. Header and Footer:
The header contains a circular chatbot avatar (chatbot.png), along with the chatbot’s name. The avatar image is styled with a border and shadow to make it stand out visually.
The footer serves as the branding section, where you can include the chatbot's name or credits. It is styled to match the header, providing visual consistency.
1.3. Chat Window:
The chat window (.chat-content) is the primary section of the interface. It serves as a scrollable area where user and bot messages are displayed.
The background of the chat window is set to whitesmoke, which makes text and messages more readable, contrasting with the darker areas around it.
2. Chat Message Design
2.1. Chat Bubbles:
The messages exchanged between the user and the bot are presented as chat bubbles, similar to modern messaging apps.

User Messages: These are styled with a blue background (#007bff) and white text. They appear aligned to the right side of the chat window.
Bot Messages: These are presented with a light grey background (#e1eafc) and black text. They appear aligned to the left.
This separation of message colors and alignment helps differentiate between the user and bot, creating a more intuitive chat experience.

2.2. Message Bubble Layout:
The chat messages are enclosed within a flex container, allowing for easy alignment and spacing.
Each chat bubble is styled with a border-radius to give it a rounded look, similar to popular messaging apps like WhatsApp or Messenger.
Box shadows are applied to add depth, making the chat bubbles feel more tactile and interactive.
2.3. Chat Scroll:
The chat content is designed to be scrollable. This ensures that as more messages are sent, the older messages remain accessible without cluttering the screen. The scroll behavior provides smooth access to the full chat history.

3. Input and Interaction
3.1. Input Section:
At the bottom of the chat container, there is an input box where the user can type messages.

The input box is styled to match the chatbot’s clean, minimal design, with light borders and a small amount of shadow for depth.
It uses a flex layout to ensure the input box and send button align neatly, even as the window is resized.
3.2. Send Button:
Next to the input box is the send button, which the user clicks to send a message. This button has interactive properties, such as:

Color Transition on Hover: When the user hovers over the button, its background color smoothly transitions from blue (#007bff) to a darker shade (#0056b3). This provides immediate feedback to the user that the button is clickable.
Shadow Effect: The button has a subtle box shadow that enhances its visibility and makes it feel more interactive.
